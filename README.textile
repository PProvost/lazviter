h2. About La-Z-Viter

La-Z-Viter was born out of necessity. My guild is a large one and we do signups and approvals via a web-based calendar and our forums. Our raid leaders and officers needed a way to quickly paste from the approval forum post into something in game and get people invited to the raid.

Using La-Z-Viter is simple. Simply copy/paste the list of members into the box and press invite. La-Z-Viter will try to do the right thing. Here are some of the rules it uses to do invites:

# The first word on each line is used as the name of the invitee
# Names that aren't in your guild roster or friends list are ignored
# If the name is "Waitlist" or "Standby" then all subsequent names are not included but will be reported in the printed summary
# Blank lines are ignored
